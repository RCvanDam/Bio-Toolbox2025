        <h2>What is Map My KEGG?</h2>
        <h3>
            Map My KEGG is a website that uses KEGG pull and KEGG mapper tools. KEGG is a database used to understand
            high-level (cell-level or higher) functions and the practical use of biological systems, such as the cell,
            organism, and ecosystem—based on molecular-level information (GenomeNet, n.d.). This information is
            primarily obtained from large-scale molecular datasets derived from genome sequencing and other
            high-throughput (partially automated, efficient) experimental technologies. The website provides options for
            analyzing and visualizing biological data at different levels. Some questions that can be answered with the
            website and the tools are:

        <p>
            •Which genes are involved in specific biological pathways and processes?<br>•How are certain metabolic
            pathways organized, and which enzymes play a role in them?<br>•What are the orthologous genes of different
            species for a given function? <br>•How can experimental data (e.g., gene expression) be integrated with
            known biological pathways? <br>•What molecular mechanisms underlie certain diseases? <br>•Which biochemical
            reactions are related to specific chemical compounds or enzymes?
