            This website uses KEGG pull and KEGG mapper tools. KEGG is a database used to understand high-level
            (cell-level or higher) functions and the practical use of biological systems, such as the cell, organism,
            and ecosystem—based on molecular-level information (GenomeNet, n.d.). This information is primarily obtained
            from large-scale molecular datasets derived from genome sequencing and other high-throughput (partially
            automated, efficient) experimental technologies. The website provides options for analyzing and visualizing
            biological data at different levels. It is suitable for various groups within the life sciences. Some of
            these groups include:
        </div>
        <div class="groups">•Researchers in bioinformatics and systems biology.<br>•Molecular biologists and
            geneticists.<br>•Students and educators in the life sciences.<br>•Bioinformaticians.
        </div>
        <div class="questions">
            The following questions can be answered with the website and the tools:
        </div>
        <div class="question_examples">
            •Which genes are involved in specific biological pathways and processes?<br>•How are certain metabolic
            pathways organized, and which enzymes play a role in them?<br>•What are the orthologous genes of different
            species for a given function? <br>•How can experimental data (e.g., gene expression) be integrated with
            known biological pathways? <br>•What molecular mechanisms underlie certain diseases? <br>•Which biochemical
            reactions are related to specific chemical compounds or enzymes?
